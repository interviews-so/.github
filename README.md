# Interviews

[Interviews](https://interviews.so) is a library of real-world programming scenarios to use as technical interviews.

**No leetcode or algorithm based questions.**

</div>

## About Interviews

**Interviews** was created to help companies hire developers based on real-world scenarios — i.e. things a developer could do on a normal day, not runtime and algorithm puzzles. The questions are designed to be open-ended and allow the candidate to demonstrate their knowledge and experience.

We provide [a blog](https://interviews.so/blog) that covers topics related to interviewing and how to get the most out of your interviews. Those articles are found in our [website repo](https://github.com/interviews-so/app).

## Pricing

We offer both free and paid content, however there is no difference in the quality of the content. The paid content is simply a way to support the project and help us continue to provide free content. A typical interview scenario will start out as a paid question and then be released for free after a period of time.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to our blog, website, and library of questions. Please see the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. **All contributions will always be free and open-source.**
